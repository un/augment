# Augmented

The Open Source Ai Agent to make you live Longer, Sharper and Better

We are currently focusing on our iOS Build

to run in dev mode:

1. Ensure you have XCode installed on your system with a version of iPhone IOS downloaded
2. run `pnpm install` in the root of the repo
3. go into `apps/mobile`
4. run `npx pod-install`
5. run `pnpm ios`
6. this will take a while to build the app on your machine, and should start an iOS simulator after
